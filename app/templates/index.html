<h1>Capital Pro Bono Honor Roll</h1>
<p>As part of the 2011 National Celebration of Pro Bono, the D.C. Access to Justice Commission and the D.C. Bar Pro Bono Program helped the D.C. Courts to establish the Capital Pro Bono Honor Roll, which annually recognized the pro bono contributions made by members of the D.C.Bar and others authorized to perform pro bono work in the District of Columbia. The Honor Roll, which is jointly sponsored by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals and the Superior Court of the District of Columbia recognizes attorneys who provide 50 or more hours of pro bono services (or 100 or more hours of service for a higher recognition category) per year. To be included in the Honor Roll, D.C. Bar members and others who are authorized to perform pro bono work in the District of Columbia should submit the online application form, which includes a declaration that they have provided the requisite number of hours of pro bono work in the calendar year. Registration for the Honor Roll honoring pro bono contributions made during calendar year 2015 ends on January 31, 2016. Participating attorneys are recognized on the <a href="http://www.dccourts.gov/internet/about/probonohonorroll/main.jsf">Courts' website</a> and elsewhere.</p>
