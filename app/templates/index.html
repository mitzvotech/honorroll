<h1>Capital Pro Bono Honor Roll</h1>
<h2>Open Letter to Pro Bono Honor Roll Registrants from Chief Judge Washington and Chief Judge Satterfield</h2>
<p>On behalf of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals and the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, we want to express our deep admiration to those attorneys who qualified for recognition on the 2014 Capital Pro Bono Honor Roll by contributing fifty hours or more to indigent individuals in need of legal representation. Your commitment to using your legal acumen to help those living in poverty is a testament to your belief in the ethical obligation we share as attorneys to help those who cannot afford counsel and to your commitment to equal access to justice.</p>
<p>Once again, the District of Columbia Bar membership and others authorized to perform pro bono legal services in the District of Columbia have manifested their strong commitment to pro bono service. Since the program’s inception, the number of participating attorneys has grown each year and 2014 was no exception. This past year, 4,257 attorneys performed over 50 hours of pro bono service, 2,571 of them provided over 100 hours of service. Honor Roll members represent a broad swath of the diverse D.C. legal community, hailing from over 150 law firms and individual practices, plus a broad array of other legal settings including corporations, law schools, local and federal government agencies and public interest organizations.</p>
<p>What a laudable accomplishment.</p>
<p>The District of Columbia is truly fortunate to have an array of talented and passionate legal services providers, who work tirelessly to meet the legal needs of those who could not otherwise afford legal assistance. Unfortunately, the urgent need for services continues to far outstrip the supply. The private bar – large law firms, government attorneys, corporate counsel, solo practitioners and small firms – are playing a pivotal role in addressing the disturbing chasm between need and supply.</p>
<p>District of Columbia attorneys have long been known for their generosity and commitment to pro bono service, and the growing number of attorneys who qualify for inclusion on the Capital Pro Bono Honor Roll each year underscores that dedication. Of course, there is always more that needs to be done. As those who have recognized the need for service, and experienced the deep satisfaction of helping those who are less fortunate, we hope you will talk to your colleagues and friends about the ethical obligation contained in Rule 6.1 of the Rules of Professional Conduct and, more importantly, why you have chosen to make pro bono service an integral part of your professional life. You have answered – and in many cases exceeded – the call for service and we are proud to recognize your commitment by the addition of your names to the Capital Pro Bono Honor Roll.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Eric T. Washington<br>
Chief Judge<br>
District of Columbia Court of Appeals</p>
<p>Lee F. Satterfield<br>
Chief Judge<br>
Superior Court of the District of Columbia</p>
