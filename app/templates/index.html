<h1>Pro Bono Honor Roll</h1>
<h2>Open Letter to Capital Pro Bono Honor Roll Registrants from Chief Judge Eric T. Washington and Chief Judge Lee F. Satterfield</h2>
<p>On behalf of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals and the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, we want to thank and congratulate those Capital Pro Bono Honor Roll attorneys for contributing fifty (50) hours or more to serving the legal needs of people living in poverty. Only with your support can we begin to close the justice gap that has captured too many for too long.</p>
<p>Starting in 2011, as part of the National Celebration of Pro Bono and with the support of the D.C. Access to Justice Commission and the D.C. Bar Pro Bono Center, the District of Columbia Courts invited attorneys to self-report their pro bono contributions over the course of a calendar year. We have received the submissions for 2013, and are prepared to formally recognize those attorneys who have qualified for inclusion on the Honor Roll.</p>
<p>Every year since its inception, we have experienced an increase in the number of attorneys registering for the Capital Pro Bono Honor Roll. In 2013, four thousand, two hundred and fifty-three (4253) attorneys performed fifty (50) hours or more of pro bono service. Of those, two thousand five hundred and sixty-two (2562) performed one hundred (100) or more hours of pro bono service, qualifying them for inclusion on the High Honor Roll. Honor Roll members represent a broad swath of the legal community, hailing from one hundred forty-three (143) law firms, and scores of solo practices, federal and local government agencies, and public interest organizations.</p>
<p>The District of Columbia is proud of its incredible legal services providers who devote their practice full-time to representing victims of domestic violence, tenants in jeopardy of imminent eviction, consumers swindled out of their life savings, and the elderly from foreclosure due to unpaid taxes. But with stretched resources and a growing demand, we must turn to private and government lawyers to serve those who otherwise would proceed without counsel and at a noticeable disadvantage.</p>
<p>Our legal community's commitment to pro bono is reflected in Rule 6.1 of the D.C. Rules of Professional Conduct, which directs D.C. Bar members to provide legal services to those unable to afford counsel. That commitment also is reflected in the number of lawyers who integrate pro bono service into their practice every year. We commend the Capital Pro Bono Honor Roll participants for their service and look forward to sending them and many new honorees our thanks for their contributions in 2014.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Eric T. Washington<br>
Chief Judge<br>
District of Columbia Court of Appeals</p>
<p>Lee F. Satterfield<br>
Chief Judge<br>
Superior Court of the District of Columbia</p>
